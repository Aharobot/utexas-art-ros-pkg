The stacks directory contains initial versions of several ROS stacks,
each with one or more ROS packages containing experimental versions of
ART software converted to use ROS instead of player.  Documentation
for these packages is here:

  http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~joq/doc/index.html

Working with the ROS build system is difficult at first.  Expect a
steep learning curve.  Working through some of the ROS tutorials is
definitely worthwhile when starting out.  Documentation:

  http://www.ros.org/wiki/ROS.

The interfaces themselves are quite good.  So are the visualization
and debugging tools.  And, there is an impressive amount of useful
robotics software already available in the ROS package system.

Overall, ROS looks like the best available technology base for future
UT/ART robotics work.  


Directions:

 (1) Check out a copy of the ART code base with ROS interfaces

     Our packages have their own Subversion project tree now.  Check
     out the trunk in ~/svn/utexas-art-ros-pkg:

     $ cd
     $ mkdir svn
     $ cd ~/svn
     $ export ART=svn+ssh://svn.landrobot.com/home/svn/art
     $ svn co $ART/ros/trunk utexas-art-ros-pkg

 (2a)[for UT CS systems]

     Set up ROS environment pointing to the shared install:

     $ cd ~/svn/utexas-art-ros-pkg
     $ bash etc/utcs-env.sh >> ~/.bashrc

 (2b)[for individually-maintained systems]

     Install ROS as in http://www.ros.org/wiki/ROS/Installation

     This is time-consuming, but not especially difficult.  Be careful
     to follow the directions exactly.  It works fine on Ubuntu and
     can be made to work for Mac OSX with some effort.  Windows will
     probably not work.

     Add the ROS environment settings to the end of your .bashrc:

     $ ~/rosconfig setup ~/ros >> ~/.bashrc

     Append our packages as well as the ROS ones (this example does it
     from the shell, or you can use any editor):

     $ cat <<EOF >> ~/.bashrc
     export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=${ROS_PACKAGE_PATH}:~/svn/utexas-art-ros-pkg
     export ROS_STACK_PATH=${ROS_STACK_PATH}:~/svn/utexas-art-ros-pkg
     EOF

 (3) Log out and log back in.

 (4) Try to run some ROS commands:

     $ rospack find velodyne_common
     $ roscd velodyne_common
     $ rosmake

       This should compile cleanly.

 (5) There is a rosemacs package, to get it working, I have to start
     emacs from a shell.  So far I cannot start it from the GNOME
     panel icon with all the required environment variables set.
